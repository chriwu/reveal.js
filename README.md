## Introduction

Topic: Merge Hell - and how to avoid it
Alt.: Collaboration on large projects in modern software development
Speakers: chriwu and nsimic


## Abstract

In modern software development, efficient collaboration in medium to large teams is often hard to achieve. The challenge grows, when the teams live in different time zones. To avoid classic pitfalls like merge hell, to safeguard due dates and ensure software quality, several strategies can be adopted. 

Defining and adopting good workflows (branching, merging, code reviews) for development teams is crucial. Choosing from a growing number of tools (SCM’s, Containerization, Continuous Integration and Deployment) to support the workflows makes developer’s life easier and allows the company to ship high quality - in time.
