					<h2>Merge Hell - and how to avoid it</h2>
					<h5>Collaboration on large projects in<br/>modern software development</h5>

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						### quick intro
						His name is Nelle, and I am Chris. Yeah, really quick.

						### opening questions
						- how many of you are taking software engineering classes?
						- how many of you have been working on teams with more than 2 people?
						- how many of you have ever used sourcecode versioning systems
					</aside>
				</section>

					<h3>Collaboration</h3>
					<p class="fragment">What is it? And why should you care?</p>
					<p class="fragment">It's about getting things done - better together!</p>

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						### Scenario
						- deadline approaching. get things out of the door
						- split up the work among your teammates
						- if separation is good - collab is easy

						### Why
						- cope with last minute problems
						- Murphys law: on day d-1 - "what can go wrong will go wrong"
						- scale out the work
						- improve quality!
						- problems: floppy disk breaks, merge hell, hidden complexity, commits disappear

						### Samples
						- hand over floppy to Nelle (it's NOT a 3d-printed print icon)
						- show image of folks playing Nintendo

						<h3>Aspects of collaboration</h3>
						<p class="fragment">On Organization level: it's all about (infra)structure <span class="fragment">and workflows</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">On Code level: it's about tools ... <span class="fragment">and workflows</span></p>

						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							### Orga
							- office, meetingrooms, network connections, etc.
							- workflows: All-hands, standups, scrum meetings
							- but most importantly: CULTURE
								- example: include TDD budget in project planning phase (TDD: 25% overhead)
							
							## Code
							- past vs present: handing over a floppy disk, index-numbering files
							- Works great in GDocs, but: in code?
							- Difficulties: large teams, oceans, team members

						### Short intro
							- We see how they help us in our daily life of creating quality software
							- But they can also foster a great culture. Bold statement. What does it mean?
							- Lets loook at the current situation in the market.
							- Software companies are under constant pressure of customers’ demands for more and more value
							- Market’s relentless drive for quarterly expectations of increased profits
							- Companies struggle to innovate under this constant pressure to deliver
							- Innovation does not come under pressure
							- Culture of Innovation. How do the workflows and tools help us here?
							- Create a culture of collaboration
							- None of us are as smart as all of us
							- If you manage to create that culture, stand back and let people work
							- Workflows and tools can help to foster and grow new ideas
							- To create innovation requires that people engage in exploring new topics, understanding, diagnosing, analyzing, modeling, creating, inventing, solving, communicating, and implementing concepts, ideas, programs.
							- For each of these steps, there is a tool that can help us along the way

							- What to take from this slide:
								- Workflows and tools are important

							Next slide: Lets take a look at some tools used for creating this presentation

							!! Around 3 mins for this !!

							- Example?: Code reviews - Github (only if there is time)

						### THIS IS TOO LONG

						### Q: Do tools influence culture or does the culture define tools?

						### Cultural differences
						As you go out into the world and search for your place in the workforce you will interview with companies that can
						be roughly divided into 4 groups:
							- Microsoft shops
							- Java shops
							- PHP shops
							- Rest of the world (Ruby, Node.JS, Python, Clojure, Elm)

						Small variations are possible, but not likely (Git in Microsoft company)
						Its about what you know and what people are comfortable with.

					<h3>Tools</h3>
					<p>Some of the tools we use at Parkside:</p>
					<img id="tools" src="img/logos_tools.svg" alt="Some tools in use at Parkside" />

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						### Questions for the audience:
							- Worked on university projects in groups of more than 2 people?
							- Used Git?
							- Anyone used something else from the list in your projects?

						- Good news / Bad news situation
						- Bad news first: this is not an extensive list of all the tools regularly used in software development
						- Good news: a single person does not use all of them (and BitBucket === GitHub)

						- Categories: PM, Development, QA, Ops, Support

						### Questions for the audience:
							- Who wants to do PM?
							- Who wants to do development?
							- Who is for Ops?

						- What to take from this slide:
							- Tools of the software developers are a legion because there are many

						Next slide: Let's concentrate on code collaboration.
						Assume we are working on a project, using versioning with git.
						Actually this presentation is a great example because it is done in reveal.js.
						The entire presentation is one large html file.
						And the same file is edited by a two person team.

						### THIS IS TOO LONG

						### Cultural differences

						As you go out into the world and search for a job you will interview with companies that can
						be roughly divided into 4 groups:
							- Microsoft shops
							- Java shops
							- PHP shops
							- Rest of the world (Ruby, Node.JS, Python, Clojure, Elm)

						Small variations are possible, but not likely (Git in Microsoft company)
						Its about what you know and what people are comfortable with.


						### PM Tools - Spectrum
							- Visual Studio Team System
							- Jira

						### Engineering Tools:
							- Same tools as PM from another perspective. A glorified TODO List.
							- Git/SVN/Mercurial/TFS for versioning
							- GitHub, GitLab, Visual Studio Team System for pull requests, code reviews
							- Skype for Teams/Hipchat/Slack for communication

						### QA
							- Same versioning tools as Engineering from another perspective.
							- Skype for Teams/Hipchat/Slack for communication
							- Unit tests, automated tests

						### Ops Questions for the audience

				<!-- slide.proven-concepts -->
				<section data-state="sl-proven-concepts">
					<h3>Proven concepts</h3>
					<p>Feature branch workflow</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Create feature branch from master</li>
						<li class="fragment">Use rebase to keep branch up to date (at least once a day)</li>
						<li class="fragment">Code-reviews</li>
						<li class="fragment">Branch-specific QA</li>
						<li class="fragment">Deploy</li>
						<li class="fragment">Merge to master</li>
						<li class="fragment">Alternative: Git-Flow</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Year-long experience, proven to be working on real large-scale projects.
						- The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch.
						- Start development == Create a feature branch from master
						- Use rebase to keep feature up to date.
						- Finish development == Put branch up for code-review (different companies, different rules)
							- Other than the obvious one there are other advantages
							- Avoid knowledge silo
							- Keeps others up to date
						- Approved == Deploy feature branch to QA
							- Collaboration with QA
						- Tested == Merge to master
						- Ops decides when == Deploy master
						- Alternative == deploy feature branch right away

						- Rebase is a bit of a sensitive subject
						- Rebase is more complicated for long running branches
						- Rebase rewrites history (considered impolite)

						- What to take from this slide:
							- Workflow works! Collaboration on code reviews, QA, Ops/DevOps.

						- Next slide: This is an ideal vision of an ideal system.
							Features are clearly defined. Customer never changes their mind.
							Work is done in a couple of days. Features are completely independent.
							And then there is reality.
